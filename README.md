AI Curl Counter mainly uses Mediapipe and OpenCV to track the number of reps the user did while doing arm curls.

Aditionally the user is given the option to play their own workout music by choosing an mp3 file of the track with the name of the 
current track being displayed during the user's workout.




How to run-
1. Make sure you have the following libraries installed- pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pygame
2. Make sure your IDE or environment is given webcam permission.
3. If your camera displays a black screen change the camera index with the "camera_index" variable, setting it to a number which makes your camera work.
