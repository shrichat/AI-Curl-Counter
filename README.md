AI Curl Counter mainly uses Mediapipe and OpenCV to track the number of reps the user did while doing arm curls, along with a customizable encouragement message. 

Aditionally the user is given the option to play the workout music they like by choosing an mp3 file of the track. The song thats currently playing is displayed while the user
works out.



How to run-
1. Make sure you have the following libraries installed by running the following command in your terminal - '''pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy pygame''' .
4. Make sure your IDE or environment is given webcam permission.
5. If your camera displays a black screen change the camera index with the "camera_index" variable, setting it to a number which makes your camera work.
